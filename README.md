Welcome and thanks for checking out my new and improved CoffeeShop App!

This is still a work in progress but should be completed soon.

Description:
Coffee Shop App v2 is a web application designed to simulate a coffee shop.

It lists products and their respective details. 
Products are stored in a MySQL database.  

===USER LOGIN/SESSION===
Allows for user login in and creates a session that will remember the user as they navigate from page to page.

Contains an admin console that allows for adding new products.
Admin console and its respective pages are restricted to admin users only.
